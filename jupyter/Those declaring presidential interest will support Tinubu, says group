Progressives Solidarity for Tinubu, a support group for the former Governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, on Wednesday, said that other aspirants would later support Tinubu’s presidential ambition.
The group at a press conference in Abuja added that Tinubu is the only candidate with “a penchant for impactful deliverables.”
The Convener of the group, Ibrahim Emokpaire, who was represented by one of the executive members, Ibrahim Idris, further said Nigerians abroad and in the diaspora were yearning for Tinubu.
He said, “Nigeria needs an unrepentant progressive, a visionary with the penchant for impactful deliverables. Nigeria needs a builder and Asiwaju’s pedigree and achievements are clear and measurable.
“He has the political will and capacity to turn our land into an El-dorado within a short time. Nigerians, both at home and in the diaspora are yearning for a Tinubu-led government that will bring succour to the people.”
